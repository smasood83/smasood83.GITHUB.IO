Using real patient data from Kaggle, I hope this article will help walk you through how we can use SQL to:

🏥 Build a histogram to show the distribution of patient visit lengths.

🧪 Use CASE statements to assess whether lab procedures impact hospital visit length.

📊 Join two tables to understand if race influences number of lab procedures.

💊 Leverage CTEs and RANK functions to understand what diabetic medicine is used the most by age group.

This SQL project analyzes World Bank's IDA data from 2022 through June 2025. 

Key insights:

 🧽 The data is a little messy with duplicate data. The article discusses how we navigate these dynamics and create cleaner datasets.
 
 💲 Projects with active loans increased over the years
 
 ⚠️ The Ukraine conflict spurred greater IDA funding needs
 
 ✅ 2,242 projects were either paid off or received credit
